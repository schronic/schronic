Dear voyeger, 

I see you made to this modest land of outlawish github content. Rest well, we have some worthwhile entertainment for you to blow your minds. 
My name is Nicolas Schroeder, and I like data. I like it a lot actually. I also like building things, and most of all I like combining the two. 

Check out my website and dont hesitate to get in touch!
